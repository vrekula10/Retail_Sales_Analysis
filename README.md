Retail Sales Performance Analysis
A data analysis project to explore and visualize retail sales performance using SQL and Power BI.  
This project aims to uncover insights such as sales trends, regional performance, and product category breakdowns.

## Objectives
- Analyze sales data to identify key trends and insights
- Build visual dashboards for business stakeholders
- Track sales performance over time, by region and product category

## Problem Statement
### Background
A global retail company operates across multiple regions and sales channels (both online and physical stores).  
Leadership faces challenges in understanding:
- Fluctuating sales performance across regions
- Underperforming product categories
- Identifying which channels are driving growth
- Evaluating profitability to guide strategic decisions
Despite having data, the information is siloed, unstructured, and lacks actionable insights.

### Business Goal
Develop a centralized Sales Performance Analysis solution to:
- Uncover trends and patterns in sales performance
- Identify top-performing regions and categories
- Compare sales trends across time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Analyze channel performance (online vs. offline)
- Evaluate profitability to recommend actionable strategies

### Business Questions to Answer
1. **Sales Trends**
   - How has total sales volume changed over time?
   - Are there specific months or quarters with significant growth or decline?
2. **Regional Analysis**
   - Which regions are contributing most to sales and profitability?
   - Are there regions consistently underperforming?
3. **Product Category Performance**
   - Which product categories generate the highest sales and profits?
   - Are there low-performing or high-potential categories?
4. **Channel Analysis**
   - How do online sales compare to offline store sales?
   - Is one channel more profitable than the other?
5. **Profitability**
   - What is the overall profit margin?
   - Which regions or categories have the healthiest margins?
6. **Growth Opportunities**
   - Where should the company focus its marketing and pricing strategies?
   - Are there regions or categories with growth potential?

### Approach
- **Data Acquisition & Cleaning:**  
  Use publicly available retail sales data. Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Use SQL to explore data, uncover patterns, and answer business questions.
- **Dashboard Development:**  
  Visualize findings in Power BI for executive-level consumption.
- **Insights & Recommendations:**  
  Summarize actionable insights and recommendations for business stakeholders.

### Expected Impact
- Enhanced decision-making through data-driven insights
- Identification of high-potential regions and categories
- Improved channel strategy (online vs. offline)
- Clear recommendations to improve profitability and sales growth
